## Brief Introduction

So basically, what conditional rendering means is based on some conditions render somthing. Simple as that. Nothing interesting. Even if you just a beginner, you might have heard somewhere or even used 'if-else' conditions in any programming languages. Same thing applies here.

### If-else

Let's see a basic example;

`If` you are logged in,then display that "you are logged in". `else`, display a button to login.

```jsx
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
  const isLogged = false;
  if (isLogged) {
    return <p> You are logged in</p>;
  } else {
    return <button>Login </button>;
  }
};

export default App;
```

There should be nothing scary about the code above. It's easily readble and without even running you should be able to predict what the code is going to produce. Change the value of `isLogged` to

### Ternary Operator `? :`

Anybody can easily understand the if-else code above. Now you wanna show off with some "advanced" knowledge right? So yeah, lets complicate things.

```jsx
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
  const isLogged = true;
  return isLogged ? <p>You are Logged in</p> : <button>login</button>;
};

export default App;
```

Okay. We just converted our verbose if-else code to something more complicated with ternary operator.

| if(isLogged) |           do this            |       else do this       |
| ------------ | :--------------------------: | :----------------------: |
| isLogged ?   | < p> You are logged in </ p> | < button>login</ button> |

What was wrong with our "if-else" code?
**Nothing** .

So what's the reason for using ternary operator instead of "if-else"?. **No Reason at all.**

### Conditional Rendering in JSX

If you look at the two codes above we can see that, we've been returning two different elements based on the the value of `isLogged`. Now let's complicate the problem a bit more. I want to return a **single** element but with different content... umm.. just look the code below.. you'll understand what I mean.

```jsx
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
  const isLogged = true;

  return(
      <div>
      {
          if(isLogged) {
            return <p> You are logged in </p>
        }
        else{
            return <button> Login </button>
        }
      }
      </div>
  )
};

export default App;

```

As we learnt in previous section, we can use javascript expression within the curly braces `{}` in jsx. So that means, if we wrap our `if-else` code with `{}` in jsx, we should get the result. But this **doesn't work**

However, using ternary operator the code works just fine. Try it.

So, whenever you want to conditionally render something within jsx using `if-esle` isn't an option.

```jsx
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
  const isLogged = true;

  return (
    <div>{isLogged ? <p>You are Logged in </p> : <button>Login </button>}</div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Conditional Rendering with Logical Operator `&&`

Consider the problem,

`If` you are logged in,then display that "you are logged in". `else`, do nothing.

Now such cases can be easily solved by making use of `null` with ternary operator like the code below where returning `null` essentially does nothing

```jsx
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
  const isLogged = false;

  return <div>{isLogged ? <p>You are Logged in </p> : null}</div>;
};

export default App;
```

But instead of returning null we could rather make use of a logical operator that exist in javascript `&&`

```jsx
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
  const isLogged = true;

  return <div>{isLogged && <p>You are Logged in </p>}</div>;
};

export default App;
```

So with `&&` operator we get to execute our `if` part of the block without caring about `else`.If you change the value of `isLogged` to false, nothing will be displayed.

//TODO
Talk about '0' rendering.
